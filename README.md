# Paladin 

This project is Work in Progress

## How to init development environment

1) Create devstack folder (ie devstack-paladin) and run `git clone git@github.com:ironexdev/paladin.git` in it

2) Init submodules
- `bin/init`
- Run from the devstack folder

3) Add following to etc/hosts
- `127.0.0.1 paladin.local`
- `127.0.0.1 mongo.paladin.local`
- `127.0.0.1 redis.paladin.local`

4) Generate Secrets
- `bin/docker/compose/secrets`
- This command will complain "No such file or directory", but files with secrets should be created anyway.

5) Start Docker
- `bin/docker/compose/up`

6) Install dependencies
- `bin/docker/app-server/composer install`

### Development notes
- App uses Custom (Base) and GraphQL API, MongoDB and Redis.
- Server logs can be found in docker/logs.
- App is protected against CSRF - every request (except GET) has to contain X-CSRF-Token header with previously obtained value from calling <api>/csrf endpoint. This value is stored in a Session.
- Used Docker services
  - app-server
  - http-proxy
  - mongo
  - mongo-express
  - redis
  - redis-admin
- It is recommended to use pretty_print function for data dumping in development.
  - Response generated by this function also contains required CORS headers for XHR debugging.
